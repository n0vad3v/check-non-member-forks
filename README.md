# check-non-member-forks

Normally, when you leave an Organization, your forks from the Org private repo will be deleted, while GitHub has made a mistake that the private fork might not be removed.

This script is used to check all the repos for forks made by non-Org members, using GitHub's GraphQL API.

## Usage

```
python main.py -t <GitHub Personal Access Token> -o <Org name>

```
âžœ  python main.py -t <GitHub Personal Access Token> -o ecenpac
